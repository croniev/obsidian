You are currently looking at the bones of my obsidian structure. The aims of this system are to manage my *Projects* and *To-Do's*, to organize my *Knowledge* and *University* stuff, and to give structure to my *Philosophy* stuff. 

In [[Z - Lernen (german)]] you can find a brief presentation about what learning is about and how it can be supported.  
[[Z - Obsidian (german)]] is a short presentation about this software and how it works, with information on the standard functionalities.  
[[!README]] and [[!README.canvas]] are the documentation of this Vaults structure, including *Plugins*, *Workflows* and more.  
[[!SYNTAX]] contains a neat overview of Obsidian Markdown syntax.
